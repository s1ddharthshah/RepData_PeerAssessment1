# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Load the data
```{r}
setwd("G:\\Learn\\Coursera\\Data Science\\5Reproducible Research\\assignment1\\submit")
file <- unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv")
data <- read.csv(file, sep=",", header=T)
head(data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
data1 <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(date = data$date), sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(data1$x, breaks = 10, main = "total number of steps taken each day", xlab = "steps", ylab = "total number")
```
Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(data1$x, na.rm = TRUE)
median(data1$x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
data2 <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(date = data$interval), sum, na.rm = TRUE)
daysCount <- length(levels(data$date))
plot(data2$x/daysCount, type = "l", main = "5-minute interval the average number of steps taken", xlab = "intervals", ylab = "average number of steps taken")
```
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
intervalsCount <- data2$x/daysCount
which.max(intervalsCount)
```
## Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset: the total number of rows with NAs
```{r}
sum(is.na(data))
```
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. use the mean for that 5-minute interval.
```{r}
newdata <- data
for(i in 1:length(newdata$steps))
  if(is.na(newdata$steps[i]))
    newdata$steps[i] <- intervalsCount[i%%288 + 1]
```
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
head(newdata)
```
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{r}
newdata1 <- aggregate(newdata$steps, by = list(date = newdata$date), sum)
hist(newdata1$x, breaks = 10, main = "total number of steps taken each day", xlab = "steps", ylab = "total number")
mean(newdata1$x)
median(newdata1$x)
```
answer:

The mean of total number of steps taken per day is different from assignment1

The median of total number of steps taken per day is the same as assignment1

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ¨C ¡°weekday¡± and ¡°weekend¡± indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day
```{r}
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", 'English')
weeklevel <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")
data$weekday <- factor(as.character(weekdays(as.Date(data$date))),order = TRUE, levels = weeklevel)
data$isweekend[as.numeric(data$weekday) > 5] <- "weekend"
data$isweekend[as.numeric(data$weekday) <= 5] <- "weekday"
data$isweekend <- factor(data$isweekend, order = TRUE, levels = c("weekday", "weekend"))
levels(data$isweekend)
```
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
```{r}
data3 <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(interval = data$interval, isweekend = data$isweekend), sum, na.rm = TRUE)
daysCount <- length(levels(data$date))
library(lattice)
xyplot(x/daysCount~interval|isweekend,data = data3, type = "l", layout = c(1,2), main = "the average number of steps taken", ylab = "the average number of steps taken", xlab = "intervals")
```
